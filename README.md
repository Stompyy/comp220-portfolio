## Portfolio pitch

### OpenGL Fire

Usable in many different projects. Depending on quantity of particles, could be made more lightweight.

- Colour change yellow -> red -> smoke grey
- Alpha channel changing throughout
- Fire acts a light source, demonstrated by lighting a nearby object
- Procedurally generated, rather than scripted paths?
- Spreadable with another log?
- Wind affected?
- Dispacement, wraps itself around an obstacle?
